  - ## Train schedule app
    - I have developed a project during my studies using Vue.js for the front end and Spring for the back end. It features internationalization on both the front end and the back end. Please note that the back-end site needs to be launched before the front-end site (the project is hosted on free servers, so it might take some time to load).
    - Here are the links to the project:
